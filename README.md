<h1>Welcome to Meme Editor!</h1>


This is a project we made for the class Audio- und Videotechnik (Audio and video technology) at HTW Berlin (Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economics).



<h3>Idea</h3>
For our class, we wanted to create a web app that allows a user to add memes to a video. It’s a quick browser-based editor that already provides the memes, so you don’t have to search them.



<h3>Prototypes</h3>

Prior to starting development of our digital prototype, we created multiple paper prototypes that match our idea. They were all pretty similar – one video component, a timeline editor and a set of memes to choose from. Below the paper prototype our digital prototype is closest to.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

- React.js
  - Timeline from 'react-visjs-timeline'
  - PerfectScrollbar from 'perfect-scrollbar'  (falls es noch drin ist )
  - (atoms, recoil?? Aaron?)
- HTML5
- CSS

<h3>Starting the application</h3>

After downloading, prior to starting the app for the first time, run “npm install” in the project directory to install all needed dependencies. Afterwards, the project can be started by running “npm start” in the project directory. When loaded, it will run on local port 3000. If the browser window doesnt pop up automatically, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
